Weekly Challenge - Lucky Number
---

Do you have a lucky number? Let's play a game: Given a number `x`, each player, in order, can increase `x` by one, decrease it by one, or do nothing. Suppose all players are smart enough, know each other's lucky numbers, and want the final `x` to be as close as possible to their own lucky numbers. What will the final `x` be?

The total number of players, the initial `x`, and the lucky number of each player in order will be given in the input.

Sample input:

```
8 10
10
6
0
8
12
42
9
3
```

Sample output:

```
9
```

What if each player has a secondary lucky number and wants the final `x` to be close to either one (prefer the first lucky number in a tie)?
