Weekly Challenge - Infinite Hanoi Theorem
---

A chimpanzee is playing The Tower of Hanoi with 2 disks. In each step, he always chooses a legal move randomly. Please calculate the probability he can win the game after N steps.

Given N < 1000, let the answer be P:

Problem (a): Calculate the float-point number P

Problem (b): Calculate the accurate value of `(P * 3N) % (109 + 7)`

Problem (c): If N < 1018, can you still solve (b)?
