We want lectures from undergraduates like you! If you've seen a cool problem, just us know and we
will schedule a time for you to talk. No need to prepare a 40-minute lecture; even 5-minute
contributions are greatly appreciated! If you do use lecture slides or show code, though,
please add it to this repository (you can click 'upload file' in github, though you'll need
to ask for permission to edit the repo.)
