Weekly Challenge - Big Truck
---

You are driving a big truck, transporting items between two locations in a city (an undirected graph). You are required to take a shortest path. However, you want to stop by several locations and pick up items. You would like to pick up as many items as possible on your trip, as long as it does not make the path longer.

Your task is to calculate the length of the shortest path and the maximum number of items you can pick up.
